          1st Topic: definition of terms
        </h1>
        <p>
          For linear equations, there is an unknown value that we have to find. This is called a variable. A variable is something that is usually denoted as a letter, usually "x", "y", or sometimes "z" but for this lesson, we'll use x as our main variable.<br>
          On the other hand, the opposite of variables are constants. These are the numbers which have a fixed value and cannot be changed in any way, unlike the variable which value can be changed. <br>
          In a linear equation, there is also a thing called "Terms" a term is a number with or without a variable. It is the values in the equation which are separated by an addition or a subtraction sign. <br>
          When you combine terms and add 1 variable to the mix, you get a linear equation or an equation with one variabel. This is usually denoted as "ax+b=c". The terms here are "ax", "b", and c. <br>
          Lastly, the "a" in the equation mentioned above is the "coefficient" of the equation. A coefficient is the number that is directly attached to the variable. Side not: if a value and another value are directly touching each other (or are connected by parenthesis), assume that it is multiplication

          2nd Topic: Simplifying
        </h1>
        <p>
           This topic requires knowlege from the topic of arithmetic. <br>
          Simplifying a linear equation is actually very simple. You just have to add like terms <br>
          Because linear equations arn't always written as "ax+b=c", you must learn how to simplify it <br>
          To simplify, you must determine which terms are variables and which are constants. Once you've found it, you must add/subtract them depending on its sign <br>
          For example, if the equation is "2x+5x+7+8=3+2", you may simplify by findint the terms with variables (2x and 5x) and constants (7, 8, 3, and 2). After that, add the variabels to get 7x <br>
          and the constants will result in (7+8=15) and on the right side, it will reult in "3+2=5". Ths gives the final equation which is 7x+15=5. And that's simplifying<br>

        3rd Topic: Transposing
        </h1>
        <p>
          This topic is all about how to balance an equation. It involves prior knowledge to our previous lessons which was all about arithmetic. <br>
          To start, a linear equation's general formula is ax+b=c as mentioned from the past 2 topics. You must think of an equation as something balanced. If you do something to the left of the equation, you must do the same to the right.
          To solve for x, we must isolate it on the left side of the equation by modifying said equation.<br>
          For ax+b=c, you can subtract b from both sides to cancel it and get ax=c-b. Then, cancel the a by dividing both sides by a (remember to keep the balance!) and get the final equation x=(c-b)/a <br>
          Let's apply it! For example you are given the equation from last topic; 2x+5x+7+8=3+2. You must simplify it first to get <br>
          7x+15=5. Next, subtract 15 from both sides to get 7x=5-15 or 7x=-10. Now, divide 7 from both sides to cancel it. It will result in x=-10/7 which is the value of x that would satisfy the equation.
