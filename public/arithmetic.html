        <h1>1st Topic: Basic operators</h1>
        
        <p>
          The most basic operators in arithmetic are addition(+) and subtraction(-). They are the most fundamental operators and will be used for almost every aspect in math.<br>
          The 2 functions are written in a general format. For addition, the format is "a+b=c" where a and b are the addends (or the ones getting added) and the c is the sum/result.<br><br>
          Subtraction is a bit trickier but it goes like "a-b=c" and a is the minuend and b is the subtrahend and c is the difference/result.<br><br>
          To solve problems involving these arithmetic functions, you have to use the principle of counting. Addition is very simple as you will only start from the 1st addend and count how many times the 2nd addend is.<br>
          Subtraction is like addition but the other way around. You start from the minuend and then start counting down to the subtrahend.<br> Very simple!!

        <h1>2nd Topic: Intermediate operators</h1>
        <p>
          The next lesson is the other 2 common operators which are multiplication(*) and division(/). Both of them rely on the principles discussed in the past lesson. <br>
          Like the basic operators, these functions are written in the general format.<br><br> For multiplication, it is "a*b=c" where a is the multiplicand and b is the multiplicator and c is the product/result. <br><br>
          For division, it goes like "a/b=c" where a is the dividend and b is the divisor and c is the quotient/result.<br> But b cannot be 0 because the whole equation will be undefined. <br><br>
          Multiplication and division uses addition and subtraction for solving. Multiplication uses repeated addition where the multiplicand will be added to itself for how much the multiplicator is (ex. 2*3 is 2+2+2 or 6). <br>
          Division is similar. The divisor will be subtracted to the dividend over and over again until the dividend becomes 0, then you take the amount of times the subtraction happened and that will be the quotient (ex. 4/2 is 4-2-2, the subtraction happened twice so the quotient is 2)
          <br><br>Quite Tricky but bearable!!
