        </h1>
        <p>
          Before going to 2nd degree polynomials, we must learn how to solve the 1st degree equations involving 1 variable, "x"<br><br>
          Basically, the principle of this topic is finding a way to 'isolate' and find the value of x such that the equation would be true.<br>
          The format of this is "ax+b=c" and the goal is to get "x=d" where d is the value that would make the equation true. <br><br>
          We achieve this using arithmetic operations. We cancel the b in "ax+b=c" by subtracting both sides by b to get "ax=c-b" and then dividing both sides by a to isolate x and get "x=(c-b)/a"
          
        </p>

          2nd Topic: factoring
        </h1>
        <p>
          A quadratic equation's general format is "ax^2+bx+c=0" where x^2 is just x*x. This equation can always be written in "a(x-p)(x-q)=0" where p and q are the zeroes or the values that would make the quadratic equation true.<br><br>
          To factor, all you need to do is to find 2 values that has a sum of b and a product equal to a and c. Then, you have to separate b to get "ax^2+dx+ex+c" such that a and d have common factors aswell as e and c.<br><br>
          Next, you have to get the GCF of a and d, and e and c. The resulting equation should be "ax(x+d)+c(x+d)" then, just divide both terms by (x+d) and put it outside, then add ax and c to get "(x+d)(ax+c)".<br>
          Lastly, just divide ax+c by a to get "a(x-p)(x-q)=0" and p and q are your answers to the quadratic equations!!!<br><br>
          Note: this method only works for certain quadratic equations where it is factorable.
